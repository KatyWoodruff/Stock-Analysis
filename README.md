# Stock-Analysis

## Overview 
For this analysis, I have refactored the original stock analysis code in order to create a more efficient and fast processing of stock information.

## Results
Acording to the provided data, almost all stock performed better in 2017 than they did in 2018, with the exceptions of RUN and TERP. Though RUN still performed well in 2017, as we can see below.

With the new refactored code, we have also seen a large improvement in runtime. Whereas the code was taking an average of 3 seconds previously, it is now taking less than 2:

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
There are many advantages to refactoring code, such as improving run time, cleanliness, and function.
However this may result in longer code and additional work, which could be a disadvantage.
As we can see, once we refactored the VBA script, we were able to run the code more efficiently and quickly. This means that the script can now be used for larger datasets, without taking too long and bgging down your system. This did take extra work, but it is overall a more effiecient and usable script.
